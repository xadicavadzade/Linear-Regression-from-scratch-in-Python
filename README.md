Gradient Descent: Salary vs. Experience (Colab Magic) 

🚀 **What it is**  
A quirky and educational Colab notebook that demonstrates gradient descent on a toy "Years of Experience vs Salary" dataset — complete with scatter plots, fitted regression line

###  Usage

2. Run the cells.
3. Tinker with `epochs`, `learning rate`, and watch the line magically improve.


> “Warning: Too many epochs may result in overfitting — and overexcited CPU usage.”  
> “This line isn’t perfect... yet. Give it more epochs (and maybe some coffee).”
